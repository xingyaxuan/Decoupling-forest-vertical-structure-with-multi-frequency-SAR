To comply with national data security regulations, the original remote sensing .tif files used in this study contain classified geographic information and therefore cannot be made publicly available.

For reproducibility purposes, we have uploaded a partial dataset in which all zero-value pixels and geographic metadata have been removed. This partial dataset can be used to verify the correctness and functionality of the provided code.

Researchers who wish to access the complete dataset may contact the
